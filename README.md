### Why the name `cuBlackDream`?  

> With artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon.  <cite>Elon Musk</cite>  cf. [WP, Oct. 24, 2014](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2014/10/24/elon-musk-with-artificial-intelligence-we-are-summoning-the-demon/?utm_term=.3a9b517cdddf)

If so, then maybe this is the stuff of *black dreams.*
